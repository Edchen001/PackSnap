##MVP
* a user can sign up/create an account
* a user can login
* a user can logout
* a user can edit and delete their profile
* Get Started will be in the nav bar
  * will allow the user to create a trip..
  * ..with many itineraries, which consist of a location, start date, and end date
* a user can search for packing suggestions based on a trip location and date (which is based on climate)
* a user can view these suggestions on their dash as well as their profile info (username, email, trips, itineraries)
* a user can view the weather forecast for their trip based on climate type
* when a user is not logged in, the search/discover will allow them to
  * search by location and date
  * this search will bring up a dash that shows them the suggested items for their trip, but does not show any profile info ('cause they're not signed in)
