"Af","Tropical Wet","No natrual seasons. The driest month has at least 60 mm (2.4 inches) of rain. Rainfall is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. All average monthly temperatures are greater than 18°C  (64°F)."
"Am","Tropical Monsoonal","Pronounced wet season. Short dry season. There are one or more months with less than 60 mm (2.4 inches). All average monthly temperatures are greater than 64°F (18°C). Highest annual temperature occurs just prior to the rainy season."
"Aw","Tropical Wet & Dry","Winter dry season. There are more than two months with less than 60 mm (2.4 inches) . All average monthly temperatures are greater than 18°C  (64°F)."
"As","Tropical Savana","Tropical savanna climates have monthly mean temperatures above 18 °C (64 °F) in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having precipitation less than 60 mm."
"BWh","Subtropical Dry Arid (Desert)","Low-latitude desert. Evaporation exceeds precipitation on average but is less than half potential evaporation. Average temperature is more than 18°C  (64°F). Frost is absent or infrequent."
"BWk","Mid-latitude Dry Arid (Desert)","Mid-latitude desert. Evaporation exceeds precipitation on average but is less than half potential evaporation. Average temperature is less than 18°C  (64°F). Winter has below freezing temperatures."

"BSk","Mid-latitude Dry Semiarid (Steppe)","Mid-latitude dry. Evaporation exceeds precipitation on average but is less than potential evaporation. Average temperature is less than 18°C  (64°F)."
"Csa","Interior Mediterranean","Mild with dry, hot summer. Warmest month has average temperature more than 72°F (22°C). At least four months with average temperatures over 50°F (10°C). Frost danger in winter. At least three times as much precipitation during wettest winter months as in the driest summer month."
"Csb","Coastal Mediterranean","Mild with cool, dry summer. No month with average temperature of warmest months are over 22°C (72°F). At least four months with average temperatures over 50°F (10°C). Frost danger in winter. At least three times as much precipitation during wettest winter months as in the driest summer month."
"Csc","Dry-summer maritime subalpine","This climate exists in high-elevation areas adjacent to coastal Csb climate areas, where the strong maritime influence prevent the average winter monthly temperature from dropping below −3 °C. This climate is extremely rare and is only found in isolated areas of the Cascades and Andes Mountains, as the dry-summer climate extends further poleward in the Americas than elsewhere."
"Cfa","Humid Subtropical","Mild with no dry season, hot summer. Average temperature of warmest months are over 22°C (72°F). Average temperature of coldest month is under 18°C  (64°F). Year around rainfall but highly variable."
"Cfb","Marine - Mild Winter","Mild with no dry season, warm summer. Average temperature of all months is lower than 22°C (72°F). At least four months with average temperatures over 50°F (10°C). Year around equally spread rainfall."
"Cfc","Marine - Cool Winter","Mild with no dry season, cool summer. Average temperature of all months is lower than 22°C (72°F). There are one to three months with average temperatures over 50°F (10°C). Year around equally spread rainfall."
